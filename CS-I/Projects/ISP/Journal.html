    <p> This first week of working on my ISP Journal has been a short week.
      All we have done so far for this project is create this Journal.
      My only problem that I have ran into is my time avaliability after
      school since I am the manager or the basketball team and have been
      staying afte school later since we have started our district games.

    <h3> ISP Roles </h3>
  <p> Software Development Engineer. For our ISP project the
    Softwre Development Engineer will be the person who is the lead programmer
    and over the overall software of our ISP. There main responsibility on the
    team will be coding new features and coding the initial project. I like
    this job and feel like it woud sutie me well since I have a solid basis
    in writing code.
  </p>
  <p> QA (Quality Assurance) Engineer. The QA Engineer job is look through the
    code and debug it. They would check errors and warnings and run the code to see
    mistakes and check to make sure the code is fufiling it's intended purpose.
    The QA Engineer would then make suggestions or edits to the code.I think I could
    do this job but know I would not be the best since I can overlook the fine details.</p>
  <p>Project Manager. The project Manager is the head of the project. They will create
    a plan and work to make sure it is executed. In our ISP project the project manager
    will still code our ISP but they will also likely make major decisions on the project
    like whether you use a GUI or CLI, or how the project will accomplish it's intended
    purpose. I don't think I woud be a good fit as a project manager since I don't really
  have any ideas on a project to create or design.</p>
  <p> Product Manager. Product managers are responsible for the current state of the product.
    They create a strtegy to complete and create the project. For our ISP project the
    product manager will also have a primary role in coding our project with the QA Engineer and Software Development Engineer. I feel like I would be good at being a product manager due to it being a position where you are working for the betterment of the project and more of a execution based role then planning. </p>
  <p> Release Engineer. They work on the release date and making sure the product is finalized ad assign deadlines for the project. I feel like I could be ok at this but I feel like I would be bad at assigning release dates and onn perfecting the small details of the project for completion.</p>
