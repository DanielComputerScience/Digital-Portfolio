    <h2> Allen BYOB </h2>
    It is absolutley blasphoumos that this is happening!!! Allen Independent School District is ending their previous long held practice of BYOD for students. In the beginning of 2020 amist the Covid19 Pandemic Allen ISD started providing students to acess to school issued devices outside of school premises.</h2>

<h1> May- 5 Gov Vs. A.I. </h1>

<h2> In 2023 President Joe Biden is meeting with tech giants Microsoft and Google, two leaders in Artificial Intellegence with Bing A.I. and Google's A.I. built in to their search engines. Biden is speaking with them currently amist the dangers of the potential of A.I. with their new strives in capabilities amongst their rise. Joey seems to be talking to these companies about regulation though that may not be what needs to be regulated right now. These A.I. modes are just chat bots to help with remedial task but there are Big pharmacy companies making millions of Americans pay hundreds for medication needed to live.</h2>
